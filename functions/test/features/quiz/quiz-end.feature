Feature:
    As a host who is managing a quiz round
    I want to end the round
    So that players scores can be calculated
    And the round can be marked as over

        When I call the "QuizRoundEnd" endpoint with:
            | quizId  | {{ game.uid }}           |
            | roundId | {{ quiz.rounds[1].uid }} |
        And I call the "QuizRoundEnd" endpoint with:
            | quizId  | {{ game.uid }}           |
            | roundId | {{ quiz.rounds[2].uid }} |
        And I call the "QuizEnd" endpoint with:
            | quizId | {{ game.uid }} |
        Then there is a collection "games" with document "{{ game.uid }}"
        And there is a sub-collection "players" with document "{{ game.players[1].uid }}"
        And the document contains:
            | message | Quiz Round Scores: 3, 3   |
            | score   | 6                         |
            | user    | {{ game.players[1].uid }} |
        Then there is a collection "games" with document "{{ game.uid }}"
        And there is a sub-collection "players" with document "{{ game.players[2].uid }}"
        And the document contains:
            | message | Quiz Round Scores: 1, 2   |
            | score   | 3                         |
            | user    | {{ game.players[2].uid }} |
